In order to run the unit tests or to use in a development environment,
you will need to provide a Amazon Web Services access key and secret key.

for the client specs you will need to create a file called

.aws.js in the plugins folder

that has the following Amazon Service values for your AWS Acouunt:

var AWS = {
    accessKeyId:'YOU ADD YOURS HERE',
    secretKey:'YOU ADD YOURS HERE'
};

similarly to enable the server side use create this file in the WEB-INF/jsx/app.

in each of the *-spec,js files, and/or if you are using the serverside
implementation, you must provide them in WEB-INF/jsx/app/configs/environments.js

These are actually in pretty good working order and I've been meaning to publish
but I had to clean out my personal AWS service codes before commiting to git.

For all the spec, you must be running in tomcat or jetty or have your own server
side proxy configured.  this folder can be dropped directly into tomcat/waebapps
and will be ready to run.
